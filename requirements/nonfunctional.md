# Non-Functional Requirements

## Customer

1. As a customer, I want the platform to be lightweight and fast so that it loads quickly and placing orders does not feel slow.

2. As a customer, I want the platform to be intuitive to use so that I can search meals, order ingredients, and track deliveries without confusion.

3. As a customer, I want the system to not lose order details if the system crashes so that my order information is preserved and I don't lose my orders or need to re-enter my orders.

## Admin/ Catering Manager

4. As a catering manager/ admin, I want the system to be easy to extend with new meal types or dietary rules so that the service can evolve without major redesign.

## Developer

5. As a developer, I want the system to be well-structured and maintainable so that I can easily understand, modify, and debug the system.

6. As a developer, I want the system to support safe data persistence so that order data remains consistent and recoverable in case of failures.
